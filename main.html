    <h2>Virtual Reality Headset</h2>
    <p>Virtual reality VR Box headset is a head-mounted device that you wear over your eyes like a pair of goggles. This vr device provides virtual reality for the wearer.Two images are passed through the lens, one for each eye, similar to how our eyes perceive and process visuals in the real world. Additionally, images in VR headsets appear to move side-to-side to recreate a 360-degree experience and is achieved by subtly moving the display content in response to head tracking data.</p>

    <h2>Projector - handmade always made with love</h2>
    <p>A projector or image projector is an optical device that projects an image (or moving images) onto a surface, commonly a projection screen. Most projectors create an image by shining a light through a small transparent lens, but some newer types of projectors can project the image directly, by using lasers. A virtual retinal display, or retinal projector, is a projector that projects an image directly on the retina instead of using an external projection screen</p>
